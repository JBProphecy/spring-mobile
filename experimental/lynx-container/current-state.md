I'm no longer working on this stuff. It works pretty great aside from me not figuring out how to implement scroll momentum with gestures... that or me not giving it enough time, but I gave it a lot of time. I know that setting up navigation and routing with this thing is gonna be a whole nother level, so I'm done for now, but I'll prolly come back to this and refine it later once I get a heavy dose of cool shit in my application, so that way I don't feel like I'm wasting my time making things that are somewhat cool and possibly useful, but lacking in the conventional and comprehensive zones.
