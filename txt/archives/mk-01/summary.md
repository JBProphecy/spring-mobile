# Mk 01 - Summary

This was my first attempt at making the bottom navigation bar tab link thing I'd been thinking about and wanting to make for a while. I thought it was going to be really tough, and it was, but I did it. This stuff is a little broken now, but when it worked it used the normal scroll behavior stuff and everything was actually pretty smooth. I've deprecated this stuff as it's evolved into the new Lynx Container, which uses gestures instead of the familiar scroll behavior, and that which also lacks scroll momentum now.
